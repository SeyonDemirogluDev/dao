# Decentralized Autonomous Organisation
**A DAO or Decentralized Autonomous Organisation is a decentralized organisation controlled by a wide range of participants, called `governors`. DAOs act on behalf of the governors' decisions. Usually, governors hold the DAO's `governance token`, which acts like a share in the DAO, just like a share in a corporation. The more governance tokens you own, the more voting power and sometimes more financial benefits you have, identical to a shareholder in a corporation in the traditional world.**
